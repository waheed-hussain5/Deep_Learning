It’s a well-known beginner-friendly competition, ideal for exploring image classification techniques and experimenting with deep learning models. Participants use a dataset of labeled training images to build models that can accurately predict the labels for a set of unlabeled test images. The competition is a great entry point for those interested in computer vision, allowing them to apply neural networks and other machine learning techniques while competing against a global community of learners and experts."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b342cd39","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.006597,"end_time":"2024-11-12T21:23:11.975561","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-11-12T21:23:11.968964","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["#
